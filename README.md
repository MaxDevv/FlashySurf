# FlashySurf - Flash Cards for Passive SAT Learning

FlashySurf is a browser extension that helps you prepare for the SAT while you browse the web. Instead of dedicating specific study time, FlashySurf integrates SAT practice questions into your regular browsing experience, making preparation passive and consistent.

## üéØ Purpose

Designed for students aiming for high SAT scores (1500+) without the need for intensive dedicated study sessions. FlashySurf turns your regular web browsing time into productive SAT preparation through spaced repetition and passive learning.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Passive Learning**: Random SAT questions appear while you browse the web
- **Math & English Coverage**: Questions from both SAT sections
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks your accuracy with a small badge
- **Explanation Feedback**: Provides detailed explanations for each answer
- **Note-Taking**: Record your understanding of incorrect answers to reinforce learning
- **Non-intrusive**: Designed to integrate into your browsing without being disruptive
- **Customizable Frequency**: Control how often flashcards appear with the settings panel

## üìã Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## üöÄ Installation

### Browser Extension (Recommended)

1. Visit the extension store for your browser:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ldajenfdgimgdajklkohhljdgdalcedb?utm_source=item-share-c)

2. Search for "FlashySurf" and click "Add to Browser"

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Download the extension files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaxDevv/FlashySurf)
2. Unzip the files to a folder on your computer
3. In Chrome/Edge, go to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

### Userscript Version (Alternative)

If you prefer using a userscript manager:

1. Install a userscript manager extension with storage support:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
   - [Stay iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stay-for-safari/id1591620171) (iOS)
2. Click on the following link to install the FlashySurf userscript:
   [Install FlashySurf Userscript](https://github.com/MaxDevv/flashysurf/raw/main/flashySurf-userscript.user.js)
3. Confirm the installation when prompted by your userscript manager

## üîß How It Works

FlashySurf randomly presents SAT practice questions while you browse the web. When a question appears:

1. Read the question and select your answer
2. Get immediate feedback on your choice
3. Review the explanation to understand the correct approach
4. For incorrect answers, take notes on your understanding to reinforce learning
5. The flashcard will automatically close after a short period (longer for incorrect answers to give you time to learn)

The extension tracks your performance over time, helping you identify areas for improvement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Click on the FlashySurf icon in your browser toolbar to:
- Adjust the frequency of flashcard appearances
- View your performance statistics
- Review your saved notes from incorrect answers
- Access additional settings

## üß† Learning Approach

FlashySurf uses principles of spaced repetition and passive learning to help you absorb SAT content gradually over time. By integrating practice into your daily browsing, you'll build familiarity with SAT question patterns without dedicated study sessions.
