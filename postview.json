It&rsquo;s conventional to use a semicolon to separate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after &ldquo;2009&rdquo; is conventionally used to separate the first item (&ldquo;the world&rsquo;s&hellip;2009&rdquo;) and the second item (&ldquo;an online&hellip;2010&rdquo;) in the series of things that Hinson helped create. Further, the comma after &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after &ldquo;app,&rdquo; and the comma after &ldquo;network&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after &ldquo;TV&rdquo; to set off the supplemental elements (&ldquo;Chickasaw Basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chickasaw TV&rdquo;) that provide the names of the app and the TV network, respectively. Altogether, the punctuation in this choice results in a sentence that clearly indicates that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015.
