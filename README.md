# FlashySurf - Flash Cards for Passive SAT Learning

FlashySurf is a userscript that helps you prepare for the SAT while you browse the web. Instead of dedicating specific study time, FlashySurf integrates SAT practice questions into your regular browsing experience, making preparation passive and consistent.

## üéØ Purpose

Designed for students aiming for high SAT scores (1500+) without the need for intensive dedicated study sessions. FlashySurf turns your regular web browsing time into productive SAT preparation through spaced repetition and passive learning.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Passive Learning**: Random SAT questions appear while you browse the web
- **Math & English Coverage**: Questions from both SAT sections
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks your accuracy with a small badge
- **Explanation Feedback**: Provides detailed explanations for each answer
- **Non-intrusive**: Designed to integrate into your browsing without being disruptive

## üìã Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- A userscript manager extension with storage support:
  - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
  - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
  - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)

## üöÄ Installation

1. Install a userscript manager extension (see Requirements)
2. Click on the following link to install the FlashySurf userscript:
   [Install FlashySurf](https://github.com/MaxDevv/flashysurf/raw/main/flashySurf-userscript.user.js)
3. Confirm the installation when prompted by your userscript manager

## üîß How It Works

FlashySurf randomly presents SAT practice questions while you browse the web. When a question appears:

1. Read the question and select your answer
2. Get immediate feedback on your choice
3. Review the explanation to understand the correct approach
4. The flashcard will automatically close after a short period (longer for incorrect answers to give you time to learn)

The script tracks your performance over time, helping you identify areas for improvement.

## üß† Learning Approach

FlashySurf uses principles of spaced repetition and passive learning to help you absorb SAT content gradually over time. By integrating practice into your daily browsing, you'll build familiarity with SAT question patterns without dedicated study sessions.

## üîú Upcoming Features

- Text input support for math problems requiring numerical answers
- Customizable frequency of flashcard appearances
- Topic filtering to focus on specific areas
- Progress analytics to track improvement over time
