# FlashySurf - Flash Cards for Passive SAT Learning

FlashySurf is a browser extension that helps you prepare for the SAT while you browse the web. Instead of dedicating specific study time, FlashySurf integrates SAT practice questions into your regular browsing experience, making preparation passive and consistent.

## üéØ Purpose

Designed for students aiming for high SAT scores (1500+) without the need for intensive dedicated study sessions. FlashySurf turns your regular web browsing time into productive SAT preparation through spaced repetition and passive learning.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Passive Learning**: Random SAT questions appear while you browse the web
- **Intelligent Question Selection**: Advanced algorithm that adapts to your performance patterns
- **Semantic Clustering**: Questions are grouped by topic similarity to target your weak areas
- **Math & English Coverage**: Questions from both SAT sections with balanced distribution
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks your accuracy with a small badge
- **Explanation Feedback**: Provides detailed explanations for each answer
- **Note-Taking**: Record your understanding of incorrect answers to reinforce learning
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns from your mistakes and focuses on challenging areas
- **Non-intrusive**: Designed to integrate into your browsing without being disruptive
- **Customizable Frequency**: Control how often flashcards appear with the settings panel

## üìã Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## üöÄ Installation

### Browser Extension (Recommended)

1. Visit the extension store for your browser:
   - [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ldajenfdgimgdajklkohhljdgdalcedb?utm_source=item-share-c)

2. Search for "FlashySurf" and click "Add to Browser"

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Download the extension files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaxDevv/FlashySurf)
2. Unzip the files to a folder on your computer
3. In Chrome/Edge, go to `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

### ~~Userscript Version (Alternative)~~
*Note: The userscript version has been discontinued due to maintenance difficulties*

<details>
<summary>Userscript Installation (Deprecated)</summary>

If you prefer using a userscript manager:
1. Install a userscript manager extension with storage support:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
   - [Stay iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stay-for-safari/id1591620171) (iOS)
2. Click on the following link to install the FlashySurf userscript:
   [Install FlashySurf Userscript](https://github.com/MaxDevv/flashysurf/raw/main/flashySurf-userscript.user.js)
3. Confirm the installation when prompted by your userscript manager

</details>

## üîß How It Works

FlashySurf uses an intelligent question selection system to present SAT practice questions while you browse the web. The system employs three different strategies:

### Question Selection Algorithm
- **50% New Questions**: Fresh questions you haven't seen before, avoiding recently answered ones
- **30% Targeted Practice**: Questions semantically similar to ones you've struggled with, using clustering analysis to identify your weak topic areas
- **20% Review Questions**: Direct review of questions you previously answered incorrectly

### Learning Process
When a question appears:

1. Read the question and select your answer
2. Get immediate feedback on your choice
3. Review the explanation to understand the correct approach
4. For incorrect answers, take notes on your understanding to reinforce learning
5. The flashcard will automatically close after a short period (longer for incorrect answers to give you time to learn)

The extension tracks your performance over time and uses semantic clustering to identify topic areas where you need more practice, automatically adjusting future question selection to target your weaknesses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Click on the FlashySurf icon in your browser toolbar to:
- Adjust the frequency of flashcard appearances
- View your performance statistics
- Review your saved notes from incorrect answers
- Access additional settings

## üß† Learning Approach

FlashySurf uses principles of spaced repetition, adaptive learning, and passive engagement to help you absorb SAT content gradually over time. Key features include:

- **Semantic Clustering**: Questions are grouped into 87 topic clusters using advanced similarity analysis
- **Adaptive Targeting**: The system identifies your least accurate topic areas and increases exposure to similar questions
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Question difficulty and topic selection adapt based on your historical performance
- **Balanced Coverage**: Ensures you see both math and English questions in proper proportion

By integrating practice into your daily browsing, you'll build familiarity with SAT question patterns without dedicated study sessions while receiving personalized attention to your areas of weakness.
