# FlashySurf - Flash Cards for Passive Study

FlashySurf is a browser extension that helps you study any subject while you browse the web. With v2.0, FlashySurf expands beyond SAT preparation to support custom flashcard collections, allowing you to study anything through passive learning integrated into your regular browsing experience.

## üéØ Purpose

Designed for learners who want to study without dedicated study sessions. FlashySurf turns your regular web browsing time into productive learning through spaced repetition and passive learning. With v2.0, the extension now supports custom flashcard collections, enabling you to study any subject matter while maintaining the core passive learning experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Flashcard Collections**: Create, import, and manage your own flashcard collections for any subject
- **Intelligent Question Selection**: Advanced algorithm that adapts to your performance patterns
- **Semantic Clustering**: Questions are grouped by topic similarity to target your weak areas
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks your accuracy with a small badge
- **Explanation Feedback**: Provides detailed explanations for each answer
- **Note-Taking**: Record your understanding of incorrect answers to reinforce learning
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns from your mistakes and focuses on challenging areas
- **Non-intrusive**: Designed to integrate into your browsing without being disruptive
- **Customizable Frequency**: Control how often flashcards appear with the settings panel
- **Performance Reports**: Generate personalized reports identifying your weakest topic areas

## üîß How It Works

FlashySurf uses an intelligent question selection system to present questions while you browse the web. With v2.0, the system now supports both SAT questions and custom flashcard collections. The system employs three different strategies:

### Question Selection Algorithm
- **50% New Questions**: Fresh questions you haven't seen before, avoiding recently answered ones
- **35% Targeted Practice**: Questions semantically similar to ones you've struggled with, using clustering analysis to identify your weak topic areas
- **15% Review Questions**: Direct review of questions you previously answered incorrectly

### Learning Process
When a question appears:

1. Read the question and select your answer
2. Get immediate feedback on your choice
3. Review the explanation to understand the correct approach
4. For incorrect answers, take notes on your understanding to reinforce learning
5. The flashcard will then give you the option close after a short period (requires note taking for incorrect answers to force you to learn)

The extension tracks your performance over time and uses semantic clustering to identify topic areas where you need more practice, automatically adjusting future question selection to target your weaknesses. With v2.0, you can now create and manage multiple flashcard collections, enabling you to study any subject matter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Click on the FlashySurf icon in your browser toolbar to:
- Adjust the frequency of flashcard appearances
- View your performance statistics across all active collections
- Review your saved notes from incorrect answers
- Manage your flashcard collections (create, import, edit, delete)
- Enable/disable specific flashcard collections
- Access additional settings

With v2.0, the configuration panel has been enhanced to support custom flashcard collections, allowing you to manage multiple collections and track your progress across different subjects.

## üß† Learning Approach (SAT Specific)

FlashySurf uses principles of spaced repetition, adaptive learning, and passive engagement to help you absorb SAT content gradually over time. Key features include:

- **Semantic Clustering**: Questions are grouped into 87 topic clusters using advanced similarity analysis
- **Adaptive Targeting**: The system identifies your least accurate topic areas and increases exposure to similar questions
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Question difficulty and topic selection adapt based on your historical performance
- **Balanced Coverage**: Ensures you see both math and English questions in proper proportion

By integrating practice into your daily browsing, you'll build familiarity with SAT question patterns without dedicated study sessions while receiving personalized attention to your areas of weakness.

# Changelog
## 2.0
### 2.0
   - FINALLY DONE! (Kinda).
   - Okay, lemme explain: FlashySurf V1 has been fully focused on the SAT, focused on only studying the sat, but after seeing the 60-100 point increases from multiple friends, reviews and even myself, I decided that flashysurf should grow beyond just the SAT, and that is V2.0
